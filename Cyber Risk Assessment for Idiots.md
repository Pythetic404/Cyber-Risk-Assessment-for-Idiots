# Cyber Risk Assessment for Idiots

## Step 1: Define Objectives and Scope
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Identify the objectives</mark> of the assessment and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">define the scope</mark>. Determine <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">what assets will be assessed</mark> and any specific concerns regarding threats and vulnerabilities.

## Step 2: Conduct Asset Inventory
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Create a comprehensive inventory of all assets</mark> within the defined scope. This includes hardware devices, software systems, data repositories, and any other components relevant to the assessment.

## Step 3: Assess Threats
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Identify potential threats</mark> to the assets identified in Step 2. Consider various threat actors, their motivations, and potential attack vectors. Use available frameworks and resources for guidance.
Remember a Threat is any potential danger or harmful event that can exploit a vulnerability.

## Step 4: Evaluate Vulnerabilities
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Assess vulnerabilities present in the assets.</mark> Use guidance from reputable sources such as NIST, CIS, and OWASP to identify common vulnerabilities. Consider factors like weak configurations, unpatched software, and insecure network architecture. A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, network, or process that could be exploited by a threat actor

## Step 5: Analyze Risks
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Estimate the likelihood and potential impact</mark> of each identified threat exploiting vulnerabilities. Prioritize risks based on severity and potential consequences. Consider using qualitative assessments like risk matrices.

## Step 6: Develop Mitigation Strategies
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Determine the best strategies to mitigate identified risks.</mark> Focus on practical measures like <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">patching vulnerabilities, implementing security controls</mark>, and improving security awareness. Consider the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of mitigation options. Use a template such as this one from 

## Step 7: Document Findings
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Document the findings</mark> of the assessment in a structured manner. Include information on identified threats, vulnerabilities, associated risks, and recommended mitigation strategies. Use tables, charts, or diagrams to illustrate key findings. Use a template such as this one from Nist

## Step 8: Report and Recommend
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Prepare a concise report summarizing the assessment findings and recommendations.</mark> Include an executive summary, methodology, key findings, risk analysis, recommendations, and references to relevant standards and resources.

## Step 9: Implement Remediation Actions
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Implement the recommended mitigation strategies to address identified risks. </mark>Prioritize actions based on severity and available resources. Monitor progress and adjust strategies as needed.

## Step 10: Review and Update
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Regularly review and update the risk assessment</mark> to reflect changes in the organization's environment, technology landscape, and threat landscape. Continuously improve cybersecurity posture based on lessons learned.
